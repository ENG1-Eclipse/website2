<h2>Week 5 Gantt Chart</h2>

Week 5 was the final week of this Assessment, as the project deadline is Wednesday 10th. As a result, this is the final Gantt Chart. 
<br>
<br>
There have been nearly no changes since the Week 4 Gantt Chart, as we're still on the same track. The only difference is the removal of the Self-Assessment table, as this was optional and we have chosen not to do it.
