<h2>Week 2 Gantt Chart</h2>

In Week 2, we had to create a new Gantt chart as the previous team did not provide us with an editable copy of their version, which didn't include Assessment 2 anyway.
<br>
<br>
This chart outlines the progress we intend to make between Weeks 2 and 5 of Spring Term, working towards Assessment 2.
