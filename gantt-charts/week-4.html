<h2>Week 4 Gantt Chart</h2>

In Week 4, we made a few changes to the Gantt chart, to better reflect where we are in the project.
<br>
<br>
We extended change reporting to the original deliverables into Week 4, since this hasn't been completed yet. We also brought forward some of the Continuous Integration documentation, as we were ready to begin this early.
