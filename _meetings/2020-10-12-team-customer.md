- The game should be interasting not to easy but not to hard.
- A lot of the game play desicions is upto us
- The rules of the game should be gotten across quickly and the game should assume very little prior knowledge
- The controls are up to us
- there should be no extreme violence in the game however the graphics should be engaging
- the game should be cross platform and should scale to different computers
