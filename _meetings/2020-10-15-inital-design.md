-   Game Engine Decision:

    -   Looked at 'PlayN' Java game engine due to its cross-platform capability, which was one of the customer requirements. 

        -   However the documentation and tutorials available for it were not very expansive.

        -   This would've been difficult to progress forward with if we reached a roadblock during the production of the application which required precise research to overcome.

    -   Instead we explored the 'libgdx' game engine, which was extensively documented on different websites and in books.

    -   This would make the programming process a lot easier as we are using an engine none of our team have experience with.

    -   It would also help our program be more appealing to teams which will undertake our game after Christmas.
