<h2> Manual Software Test </h2>
Here, we test 005 - Are all elements of the game scalable?

<br> This test was done manually, with the criteria that the tester should change the resolution of the computer and run the game. Then, check ‘HOW TO PLAY’ menu and play the game.

<br> For evidence, see the videos below. The first video shows the game working normally:
