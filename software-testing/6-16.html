<h2> Manual Software Tests </h2>
Here, we test:
<br> - 006: Can the player heal their health?
<br> - 016: Does the infirmary contain some way to heal the player?
<br>
<br> This test was done manually.
<br>
<br> The criteria for testing 006 are as follows: Tester should take damage from the operative. Then, enter the medbay system and check if the health of the player is increasing gradually. After that, take damage again and pick up heal or regen power up and the health should increase instantly or gradually respectively. (Medbay and power ups can be tested in any order).
<br>
<br> The criteria for testing 016 are as follows: Tester should take some damage from an infiltrator, and then move to the infirmary (shown on minimap). They should then check that after some time, their health increases.
