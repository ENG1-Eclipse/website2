<h2> Manual Software Tests </h2>
Here, we test:
<br> - 008: Is the player notified when a system is under attack?
<br> - 009: Is the location of the system that is under attack displayed?
<br>
<br> This test was done manually, with the criteria that the tester should start the game and wait until systems will be under attack and check whether notification about what system and when appeared in the notification log at the bottom right of the screen.
<br>
<br> For evidence, see the video below:
