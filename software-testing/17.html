<h2> Manual Software Test </h2>
Here, we test 017 - Does the game have a demo mode, not requiring user input?
<br>
<br> This test was done manually, with the criteria that the tester should launch game, click play, and then click the ‘DEMO’ button, and  give no further input
<br>
<br> For evidence, see the video below:
