<h2> Automated Software Test </h2>
Here, we test 021 - Do the relevant assets exist within the game files?
<br> This ensures that all assets required for the game are present. 

<br>
<br> 

This was tested via automated testing using LibGDX Testing, <a href="https://github.com/TomGrill/gdx-testing">created by TomGrill</a>. 
<br>
<br>We used the following methods in the test, which are then checked by a parent method to determine a pass or fail:
<br> - mapAssetsExist() - Checks all map assets exist in the game.
<br> - skinAssetsExist() - Checks all character assets exist in the game.
<br> - audioAssetsExist() - Checks all audio files are present.
<br> - imgAssetsExist() - Checks all other in-game images are present.
<br> - imgMenuAssetsExist() - Checks all assets relating to in-game menus exist.
<br>
<br>The output report, showing that the test passed, is below:
