<h2> Manual Software Test </h2>
Here, we test 012 - All systems on the map must be reachable by operatives (without the use of teleport pads), and thus by the player.
<br>
<br> This test was done manually, with the criteria that the tester should move to every location shown in minimap (Available by holding ‘M’ key).
<br>
<br> For evidence, see the video below:
