<h2> Automated Software Tests </h2>
Here, we test the following:
<br>- 003: Are there 8 operatives in the game?
<br>- 010: Are there at least 15 systems in the game?
<br>- 011: Are there at least 4 room types in the game?
<br>- 013: Does the map must contain at least two teleporters?
<br>- 014: Does the map contain an infirmary room?
<br>- 015: Does the infirmary include a teleport pad?

<br>
<br> 
This was tested via automated testing using LibGDX Testing, <a href="https://github.com/TomGrill/gdx-testing">created by TomGrill</a>. 
<br>
<br>We used the following methods in the test, which then determine a pass or fail:
<br> - operativesEqualsEight() - Checks if there are eight operatives in the mapdata.json file.
<br> - systemsEqualsFifteen() - Checks if there are at least 15 rooms, and as each room has a system, 15 systems.
<br> - fourUniqueRoomsExist() - Checks there are at least four rooms with unique names.
<br> - twoTeleportersExist() - Checks if there are at least two teleporters in the data file.
<br> - oneInfirmaryRoomExists() - Loops through the names of all rooms, and ensures that one is called 'Medbay'.
<br> - medbayTeleporterExists() - Looks at the JSON entry for Medbay and checks that an integer list exists in the teleporterCoods entry.
<br>
<br>The output report, showing that the test passed, is below:
