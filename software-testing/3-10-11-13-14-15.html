<h2> Automated Software Tests </h2>
Here, we test the following:
<br>- 003: Are there 8 operatives in the game?
<br>- 010: Are there at least 15 systems in the game?
<br>- 011: Are there at least 4 room types in the game?
<br>- 013: Does the map must contain at least two teleporters?
<br>- 014: Does the map contain an infirmary room?
<br>- 015: Does the infirmary include a teleport pad?

<br>
<br> 

These were tested via automated testing using LibGDX. 
<br>
The output report, showing that the tests passed, is below:
