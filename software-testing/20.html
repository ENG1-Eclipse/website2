<h2> Manual Software Test </h2>
Here, we test 020 - Can the player save the game, and then reload it?
<br>
<br> This test was done manually, with the criteria that the tester should pause mid-way through a game, press ‘save game’ button, then exit the game and press play again. Upon being asked whether they would like to load from a saved game, they should press ‘yes’.
<br>
<br> For evidence, see the video below:
